A part of [[DevOps]] learning path
 A part of [[Git]]

- Automate build , test , release 
- We could test in different environments 
- CI -> Continuous Integration
- CI -> After every user code pushes build and test the changes ( *security , hardware and others)
- CD -> Continuous Delivery / Deployment
- ![[Image Deployment vs Delivery.png]]
- The last part in delivery need a human permission to change the product but in deployment it automatically change the product ( *delivery is better cause you could check the changes and you could deploy in a specific time )
- CD advantages ->
	1- Lower risk of your releases 
	2- Easier time to market 
	3- More quality
	4- Lowe the costs 
	5- Better products
	6- More human productivity
